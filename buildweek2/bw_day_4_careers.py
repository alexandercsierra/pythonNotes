What 3 things block resumes the most?
*not optimizing the 'top fold'
    - if you were to fold, top half
        -show best fit as quick as possible
        -make sure top half does a lot of the talking for you
*Power Statements
    -related to projects and experience
    -projects should read like work experience
        -power statements => collaborated, built, developed
        -don't just explain what your project is, explain what you did

Text, Type, and Formatting:
*1 page
*font size 11 or higher
*no periods after bullet points
* Full Stack is the correct spelling


Name and title should be at the top and easy to find
Full Stack Engineer, Software Engineer

When applying match it to the job description exactly

Summary is optional - top right near contact info

Skills
-needs to be in top half
-don't include soft skills

Projects
-be detailed
    -'solely responsible for...'
    -'wrote API calls and endpoints to facilitate information flrow'
    -active voice, begin with a strong action verb
        -built using, not this project was built with
        -implmented features
        -created user....
    -do not use responsible for, helped with, worked on, this project is/was
    -quantify deadlines, number of collaborators, any relevent details about process
        -collaborated 5 fullstack team members during 5-week sprint
        -built within 24 hours for hackathon

    -power word, app feature using tech skill/tool, 
        -developed the login feature using react

    - do not use your power statements to describe how the project works, just for what you did

    name of project
    -one sentence description
    -tech used
    -bullet points with power statements

    "contributed to a cross-functional team" vs worked on


Experience:
    what if my experience isn't tech-related?
        -quantify it
            -positive feedback
            -number of customers
            -time saved
        -highlight value adds
        -TL feedback from students?
    (subway but applies to development)
    -customer experience
    -quality product

    Have Role first then company

    2-5 bullet points is standard

    Don't list jobs non-tech related more than 5 years old
    start each with action verb

Education
    -list higher education
    -choronological order

Summary is optional
Full stack web developer skilled in <list tech stack> . Passionate about <ex:
elegant code, breaking down complex problems to find solutions, collaborating with other developers, open source, creating front-end interfaces with the user in mind> and <other similar thing you love about programming>.

Maybe have different resumes - one more focused on react, maybe one more varied (python, etc)

hiring managers want to see more completed projects
