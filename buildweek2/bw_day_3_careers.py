Behavioral Interviewing
------------------------
Wear one step above whatever the interviewer will be wearing
Send a thank you email after the interview a few hours after but no more than 24 hours



Small talk - shows interest doesn't have to give a lot of energy. Builds camraderie, rapport, trust
shop talk - similar to small talk but business-related
    -'love this office space'
    -'just read that your company received a new round of funding'

control talk - never during interviewing
    -have direction over a conversation
    -making demands/selling something

fight/spite - never during interviewing
    -arguing, blaming, sarcasm, badmouthing previous teammate/company

search talk - brainstorming, giving suggestions, speculating how or why
    -asking open-ended questions
    -inquisitive

aware - ownership, repeating what their saying for understanding


even more than salary I love the opportunity to collaborate what range did you have in mind

why should we hire you - it is clear your company values x y and z and here's why I embody those


STAR - situation, tasks, action, result
FEB - feature, example, benefit
    fact that sets you apart, specific personal example, how that fact and example benefits the employer

Have 5-6 stories that can be tweaked to answer a variety of questions. Get really comfortable telling them in different contexts, using STAR.

Questions 
How soon are you hoping to fill this role? 
What are next steps?
In phone screen, ask who will I be meeting with so you have an opportunity to look them up.

What do have to offer this company? - what they really want to know when they ask you to tell them about yourself.
'''

'''
Research the company
Read the job description
Search for connection on linkedin (know if you are connected to interviewer)
Maybe request a connection with message (hey excited to talk today)
Have an opinion about the company website
1 company screens for
    drive to learn
    the ability to think critically
    empathy

Talk about values you have that match the company you are applying for


Be Detail Oriented
-don't spell names wrong
-don't call someone the wrong name on the phone
-don't spell company name wrong
-don't miss interview for time zone issues

ask questions - not doing so can make you seem disinterested
how have you dealt with coronavirus ?
what advice would you have for me?
what does success look like at this company?


Maybe say I'm not sure at this time, but I'd love to learn. Could you tell me a little more about that?

Portfolio - doesn't have to be perfect, but wanted to know the problem that he solved and what he learned

Be able to have a brainstorming session about how to solve a particular problem and offer suggestions

Having the answer or a working project is not the most important thing. It's more important to be able to communicate your thought process.

NEVER end a question with I don't know
you can start with I don't know as long as it goes somewhere.

When you think "I don't know," that's your internal cue to demonstrate to them how you think when faced with unknowns.
