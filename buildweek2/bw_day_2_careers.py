Submitting an application
---------------------------
*review the job description
*highlight anything you have even a little experience in
*make sure your resume reflects your experience
*generally, higher things in the description are higher on the priority list for the employer
*most relevant experience => cover letter


Cardinal rule of interviewing
--------------------------------
Never ever under any circumstance answer a question with a "I don't know" unless it's followed by a "but..."
*play curiosity
    *show interest
    *"oooo this is an interesting problem. I haven't seen that before let's see what we can do with this"


Common Challenges/Concerns
---------------------------
BE/FE - is it ok to ignore the one that is worse?
*acknowledge that one is a work on progress, and focus on better one

I don't think final product is something I'm proud of
*talk about a challenge you overcame
*some aspect of it you are proud of

None of my projects are done or deployed
*share scope and timeframe
*acknowledge next steps
*show continued project

I don't have any good challenges to talk about
*everyone has challenges
*also interpersonal challenges

How do I highlight my contributions to a team project
*highlight personal contributions
*also highlight how you worked as part of a team

Questions you don't have experience with
*bring up the most related thing you do have experience with
*I haven't spent a lot of time with that particular technology, but this is what I know about it. It's been on my list of things to research for a while
*could also research after and mention in follow-up email

Unfinished projects
*update readme with future plans
    *to do list
    *make gradual updates with commit history
*if there's something cool in there, talk about that

Don't know the answer to a straightforward knowledge program
"Pick the closest thing to the tech that I'd worked on. And admit that I'd not pursued that particular tech in detail. I'd list everything at all I did know about it. 
And add that it's on my list as something to research."
